title: "Truncated LinUCB for Stochastic Linear Bandits"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/trlucb
excerpt: 'We consider contextual bandits with a finite number of arms, where the contexts are independent and identically distributed
                d-dimensional random vectors, and the expected rewards are linear in both the arm parameters and contexts. We propose a truncated version of LinUCB and termed "Tr-LinUCB", which follows LinUCB
                up to a truncation time S and performs pure exploitation afterwards. The Tr-LinUCB algorithm is shown to achieve O(dlog(T)) regret if S=Cdlog(T)
                for a sufficiently large constant C, and a matching lower bound is established, which shows the rate optimality of Tr-LinUCB in both d and T under a low dimensional regime.'
