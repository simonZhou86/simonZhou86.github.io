title: "An Attention-based Multi-Scale Feature Learning Network for Multimodal Medical Image Fusion"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dilran
excerpt: 'In this paper, we introduce a novel Dilated Residual Attention Network for the medical image fusion task to synthesize complementary information from multimodal medical images (CT and MRI) into a single image. Our network is capable to extract multi-scale deep semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel fixed fusion strategy termed Softmax-based weighted strategy based on the Softmax weights and matrix nuclear norm. Extensive experiments show our proposed network and fusion strategy exceed the state-of-the-art performance compared with reference image fusion methods on four commonly used fusion metrics.'
