title: "Edge-Enhanced Dilated Residual Attention Network for Multimodal Medical Image Fusion"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/eh_dran
excerpt: ' In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture with a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for
effective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to enhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and
efficient fusion, we present a parameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax, which requires no
additional computations during training or inference. Extensive experiments on MRI-CT, MRI-SPECT, and a downstream brain tumor classification task demonstrate that our approach outperforms various baseline methods in terms of visual quality, texture preservation, and fusion speed, making it a possible practical solution for real-world clinical applications.'
