Poster Presentation at Vector Institute Research Symposium. We take the 3.0T MRI images from the “ProstateX” challenge; translate to 1.5T-like MRI images based on the Cycle-GAN framework; and train a 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Prostate Cancer classification on translated images for the local use.
