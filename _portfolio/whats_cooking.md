**Project Intro:**
In this project, we leveraged various traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to predict the category of a dishâ€™s cuisine given a list of ingredients that used in the dish.

**Data description:**
Training dataset is in JSON format and has three attributes: recipe ID (int), the type of cuisine(object/string), and the list of ingredients (object list). Test dataset only have two attributes: recipe ID and the list of ingredients. Both attributes have the same format as they appear in Training dataset.

**Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:**
- Since the format of both training and testing dataset is the combination of string and numeric, we have to somehow convert string into numeric value for modelling.
- Removing the special characters, numbers and units(if any) in each ingredient, those may affect the true value when converting to numeric.
- Standardized words (convert all letters to lower case, remove hyphen, change word to default tense)
- Using TF-IDF algorithm to extract some significant(unique) ingredients for each recipe and convert to numeric value, this will be the features for that recipe. The result matrix is a sparse matrix.
- Since the matrix after TF-IDF is a spare matrix with a large dimension, we consider SVD method to reduce the dimension. In this case, we perform truncated SVD algorithms.

**Modelling:**
- Logistic Regression with OVR
- Support Vector Machine with OVR and linear boundary (using linear boundary due to hardware limitation)
- Random Forest
- Boosting and voting classifier
- Neural Networks
- Hyper-parameter tuning is done via GridSearchCV in Python. Random Forest and boosting & voting classifier is not reported due to low accuracy on validation dataset.
