title: "Shoulder Implant X-Ray Manufacturer Classification"
excerpt: "In this paper, we compared the performance of various deep models, ranging from traditional machine learning methods, CNN-based deep learning methods to the modern state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The results have showen that ViTs achieved a decent performance in X-Ray classification task, and transfer learning improved ViT by a large margin.<br/><img src='/images/shoulder_cover.png'>"

Shoulder replacement surgery, also called total shoulder replacement, is a common and complex surgery in Orthopedics discipline. It involves replacing a dead shoulder joint with an artificial implant. In the market, there are many artificial implant manufacturers and each of them may produce different implants with different structures compares to other providers. The problem arises in the following situation: a patient has some problems with the shoulder implant accessory and the manufacturer of that implant maybe unknown to either the patient or the doctor, therefore, correctly identification of the manufacturer is the key prior to the treatment. In this paper, we showed the performance of different machine learning and deep learning methods in classifying the manufacturer of a shoulder implant.
