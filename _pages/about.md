![My name in Chinese](http://simonZhou86.github.io/images/name_chinese.png)

Welcome! 

I obtained my Master of Science (MSc.) degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto in March 2024, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Farzad Khalvati](https://medical-imaging.utoronto.ca/faculty/farzad-khalvati) at the [Intelligent Medical Informatics Computing Systems Lab](https://imics.ca/). I was affiliated with [The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Research Institute](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/about-research-institute/), one of the top three pediatric health-care centres in the world, where I worked in the [Department of Neurosciences & Mental Health](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/research-programs/neurosciences-mental-health/).

## üìñ Research
My research interest lies at the intersection between **Deep Learning** and **Medical Imaging**, particularly in developing 3D Medical Image Generation model to improve the diagnostic (segmentation and classification) performance of rare diseases, such as (Pediatric) brain tumors. I am also interested in NLP for healthcare using LLMs. Previously, I have worked on the Sequential Decision research on Multi-Armed Bandits.

My research could be categorized into:
  - Computational Methodology in Medical Data (image, text, time series data, etc.)
  - Deep Learning applications for Medical Image Analysis
  - Medical Image Generation (Image Transformer, Diffusion, Vision-Language, LVMs, etc.)
  - NLP for clinical data (LLMs)
  - Contextual Multi-armed Bandit Problems

I am funded by the Department of Computer Science, Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Mitacs Research Grant, SickKids Hospital, and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship.
