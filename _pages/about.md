Welcome! I am currently a Master of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science Candidate at the University of Toronto, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Farzad Khalvati](https://medical-imaging.utoronto.ca/faculty/farzad-khalvati) at the [Intelligent Medical Image Computing Systems Lab](https://imics.ca/). I am also a affiliated with the [The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Research Institute](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/about-research-institute/), one of the top three paediatric health-care centres in the world. I am working in the Department of Neurosciences & Mental Health.

My current research interest lies at the intersection between *Deep Learning* and *Medical Imaging*, I am working on the 3D Medical Image Generation to improve the diagnostic performance of Paediatric Brain Tumors. I am also interested in NLP for healthcare using LLMs. Previously, I have worked on the Sequential Decision (theoretical RL) related research.

My research could be categorized into:
  - Computational Methodology in Medical Data (image, text, time series data, etc.)
  - Deep Learning applications for Medical Image Analysis
  - Medical Image Generation (Image Transformer, Diffusion, etc.)
  - NLP for clinical data
  - Contextual Multi-armed Bandit Problem

I am funded by the Department of Computer Science, Temerty Faculty of Medicine at UofT, SickKids Hospital, and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship.

I obtained my Honours Bachelor's degree in Computing, *Specialized in Computing and Mathematics* from [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/). My undergraduate honours thesis "Domain Transfer Through Image-to-Image Translation in Prostate Cancer Detection" is supervised by [Prof. Parvin Mousavi](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/people/Parvin/Mousavi) at the [Medical Informatics Laboratory](https://medi.cs.queensu.ca/) from Sept. 2021 to May 2022. I graduated from Yale Secondary School, a beautiful high school in British Columbia in June 2017.
