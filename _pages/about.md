# Meng Zhou

Welcome! I am currently a Master of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science Candidate at the University of Toronto, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Farzad Khalvati](https://medical-imaging.utoronto.ca/faculty/farzad-khalvati) at the [Intelligent Medical Informatics Computing Systems Lab](https://imics.ca/). I am also a affiliated with [The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Research Institute](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/about-research-institute/), one of the top three paediatric health-care centres in the world. I am working in the [Department of Neurosciences & Mental Health](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/research-programs/neurosciences-mental-health/).

My current research interest lies at the intersection between **Deep Learning** and **Medical Imaging**, I am working on the 3D Medical Image Generation to improve the diagnostic performance of Paediatric Brain Tumors. I am also interested in NLP for healthcare using LLMs. Previously, I have worked on the Sequential Decision research on Multi-Armed Bandits.

My research could be categorized into:
  - Computational Methodology in Medical Data (image, text, time series data, etc.)
  - Deep Learning applications for Medical Image Analysis
  - Medical Image Generation (Image Transformer, Diffusion, etc.)
  - NLP for clinical data
  - Contextual Multi-armed Bandit Problems

I am funded by the Department of Computer Science, Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Mitacs Research Grant, SickKids Hospital, and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship.

I obtained my Honours Bachelor's degree in Computing, *Specialized in Computing and Mathematics* from [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/). During my undergrad years, I have the privilege to work under the supervision of [Prof. Parvin Mousavi](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/people/Parvin/Mousavi) at the [Medical Informatics Laboratory](https://medi.cs.queensu.ca/) on my undergraduate honours thesis, "Domain Transfer Through Image-to-Image Translation in Prostate Cancer Detection"; and [Prof. Yanglei Song](https://sites.google.com/view/yangleisong) on the Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit problem. You can see more details in the Publicaton section on the top. I graduated from Yale Secondary School, a beautiful secondary school in British Columbia in June 2017.
