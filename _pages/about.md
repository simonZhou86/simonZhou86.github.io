Welcome!

I am an Applied Machine Learning Scientist at TD Bank, working on machine learning and GenAI solutions for businesses. If you are interested in what we do or our team in general, please feel free to reach out!

I have also worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at a Medical AI startup company, focused on multilingual LLMs ([Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05732)) and LLM-applications on medical document analysis.

Previously, I was in academia where I obtained my Master of Science (MSc.) degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto in March, 2024. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Farzad Khalvati](https://medical-imaging.utoronto.ca/faculty/farzad-khalvati) at the [Intelligent Medical Informatics Computing Systems Lab](https://imics.ca/). I was affiliated with [The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Research Institute](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/about-research-institute/), one of the top three pediatric health-care centres in the world, where I worked in the [Department of Neurosciences & Mental Health](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/research-programs/neurosciences-mental-health/). I have also spent a wonderful four months at [AltaML Government AI lab](https://www.govlab.ai/), working on an Aerial Image Segmentation project for the public sector.

**I am also open to any collaborations on (Multimodal) Foundation Models for Medical Imaging**

## üìñ Research
My current research interest is on **Medical LLMs**, taming LLMs for multilingual medical question-answering tasks, and **Multimodal fundation models for Medical Imaging**. I also have strong interests on **Medical Image Analysis**, particularly in developing 3D Medical Image Generation model to improve the diagnostic (segmentation and classification) performance of rare diseases, such as (Pediatric) brain tumors. Previously, I have worked on the Sequential Decision research on Multi-Armed Bandits.

My research could be categorized into:
  - Computational Methodology in Medical Data (image, text, time series data, etc.)
  - Deep Learning applications for Medical Image Analysis (image fusion)
  - Medical Image Generation (Image Transformer, Diffusion models, Vision-Language, LVMs, etc.)
  - NLP for medical text (LLMs)
  - Contextual Multi-armed Bandit Problems

I am funded by the Department of Computer Science, Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Mitacs Research Grant, SickKids Hospital, and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship.
